Mathematical functions:
- A defined Domain (Input values)
- A defined Range (Output values)

A function is a mapping between the two, 
a Mapping of a value from a domain to a value in the range
don't change input
a lookup from the preexisting list of domain values to the preexisting list of range values

Mathematical functions are deterministic
Mathematical values have no side effects
